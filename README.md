# Hakathon Day 02 – E-Commerce Documentation Hub

Welcome to **Hakathon Day 02**, dedicated to documenting the development phases of an e-commerce platform during our hackathon.

This repository collects design artifacts, architecture diagrams, deployment strategies, and test reports filed during the hackathon’s Day 2.

---

##  Project Overview

We are building a feature-rich e-commerce application with:
- Backend APIs (user auth, product catalog, orders)
- Dynamic frontend components
- Deployment-ready configuration (staging + production)
- CI/CD pipelines and best-practice testing

This repo is your single source of truth for documentation and deliverables from Day 2.

## Purpose & Vision

This documentation formed the backbone of our development sprint, enabling:

* Seamless knowledge sharing among team members
* Clear decision tracing for architecture and feature choices
* A launch-ready blueprint for continuing the project post-hackathon

---

## Next Steps

To advance this into a full-fledged project:

* Extract API designs into an OpenAPI spec
* Launch frontend prototypes (e.g., React or Vue)
* Integrate CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Netlify, etc.)
* Archive test results as part of continuous delivery
* Publish UI mockups as interactive prototypes (Figma, Storybook, etc.)
